# ixa-pipe-ned

This repository contains the Named Entity Disambiguation tool based on DBpedia Spotlight.
Providing that a DBpedia Spotlight Rest server for a given language is running, the ixa-pipe-ned module will take
NAF or KAF as input (containing <entities> elements) and perform Named Entity Disambiguation
for your language of choice.

Developed by IXA NLP Group (ixa.si.ehu.es) for the 7th Framework OpeNER and NewsReader European projects.

The contents of the repository are the following:

    + src/ source files of ixa-pipe-ned
    + pom.xml 
    + pom-naf.xml
    + README.md: This README

## Installation Procedure

In a snapshot:

 1. Install dbpedia-spotlight
 2. Compile ixa-pipe-ned module with mvn clean package
 3. Start dbpedia-spotlight server
 4. cat ner.naf | ixa-pipe-ned/target/ixa-pipe-ned-1.0.jar -p $PORT_NUMBER

If you already have installed in your machine JDK7 and MAVEN 3, please go to step 3
directly. Otherwise, follow the detailed steps:

### 1. Install JDK 1.7

If you do not install JDK 1.7 in a default location, you will probably need to configure the PATH in .bashrc or .bash_profile:

    export JAVA_HOME=/yourpath/local/java17
    export PATH=${JAVA_HOME}/bin:${PATH}


If you use tcsh you will need to specify it in your .login as follows:

    setenv JAVA_HOME /usr/java/java17
    setenv PATH ${JAVA_HOME}/bin:${PATH}


If you re-login into your shell and run the command

    java -version


You should now see that your jdk is 1.7

### 2. Install MAVEN 3

Download MAVEN 3 from

    wget http://ftp.udc.es/apache/maven/maven-3/3.0.4/binaries/apache-maven-3.0.4-bin.tar.gz

Now you need to configure the PATH. For Bash Shell:

    export MAVEN_HOME=/home/ragerri/local/apache-maven-3.0.4
    export PATH=${MAVEN_HOME}/bin:${PATH}

For tcsh shell:

    setenv MAVEN3_HOME ~/local/apache-maven-3.0.4
    setenv PATH ${MAVEN3}/bin:{PATH}

If you re-login into your shell and run the command

    mvn -version


You should see reference to the MAVEN version you have just installed plus the JDK 7 that is using.

### 3. Download statistical backend - dbpedia spotlight

Downloand from http://spotlight.sztaki.hu/downloads/
- dbpedia-spotlight-0.7.jar
- German model: de.tar.gz
- English model: en_2+2.tar.gz 
- Spanish model: es.tar.gz	
- French model: fr.tar.gz
- Italian model: it.tar.gz
- Dutch model: nl.tar.gz

Decompressed the language models 
- tar xvf $lang.tar.gz

Install dbpedia-spotlight
- go to the directory the dbpedia-spotlight.jar is located
- execute:
  mvn install:install-file -Dfile=dbpedia-spotlight-0.7.jar -DgroupId=ixa -DartifactId=dbpedia-spotlight -Dversion=0.7 -Dpackaging=jar -DgeneratePom=true
  This command will install dbpedia-spotlight jar as a local maven repository

Start the application
- java -jar dbpedia-spotlight-0.7.jar $lang http://localhost:$port/rest 

  note: When working with English, the $lang variable refers to en_2+2 


### 4. Download the ixa-pipe-ned repository

    git clone git@github.com:ixa-ehu/ixa-pipe-ned.git


### 5. Install ixa-pipe-ned

Install the ixa-pipe-ned module

    mvn clean package


This command will create a `ixa-pipe-ned/target` directory containing the
ixa-pipe-ned-1.0.jar binary with all dependencies included.

### 6. ixa-pipe-ned USAGE

The ixa-pipe-ned-1.0.jar requires a NAF document containing <entities> elements as standard input and
provides Named Entity Disambiguation as standard output. It also requires the port number as argument.
The port numbers assigned to each language are the following:

    - de: 2010
    - en: 2020
    - es: 2030
    - fr: 2040
    - it: 2050
    - nl: 2060

**Once you have a DBpedia Spotlight Rest server running you can send queries to it via the ixa-pipe-ned module as follows:

    cat ner.naf | java -jar ixa-pipe-ned-1.0.jar -p $PORT_NUMBER

### 7. ixa-pipe-ned SPECIAL USAGE

When the language is other than English, the module offers an
additional feature. It is possible to set the corresponding English entry. To execute this option:

    cat ner.naf | java -jar ixa-pipe-ned-1.0.jar -p $PORT_NUMBER -i $INDEX -n $NAME

    $INDEX is the name of the 'database' created by MapDB (http://www.mapdb.org/)
    $NAME is the name of the HashMap that the module uses

So far, we can download [wikipedia-db.tar.gz](http://ixa2.si.ehu.es/ixa-pipes/models/nerc-resources.tgz) package, which contains the
required resources for Spanish. In this particular distribution, the $INDEX is 'wikipedia-db' and the $NAME is 'esEn':

    cat ner.naf | java -jar ixa-pipe-ned-1.0.jar -p 2030 -i wikipedia-db -n esEn

It is possible to use new Maps, if they are created using MapDB. The
two elements of the HashMap have to be Strings, delimited by a tab. 


For more options running ixa-pipe-ned

    java -jar ixa-pipe-ned-1.0.jar -h
